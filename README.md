# Dominic-Karol-Natalia-Niete-database

A library app where you can add in your favourite books as recommendations for others.

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory

2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

3. Run `npm run seed` to create the database. Run `npm run seed-win` if using Windows. 

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the server. Run `npm run dev-win` if using Windows. 

This uses the nodemon library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

## Testing

## User stories

### Core

- [X] As a friendly user I want to post a book recommendation for anyone to see
- [X] As a curious user I want to see other people's book recommendations

Stretch goal: 
- [ ] As an impatient user, I want to be able to search for books by name so I don't have to scroll through an entire library of book.
